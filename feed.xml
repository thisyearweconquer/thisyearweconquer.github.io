Sometimes horrible things happen to good people. Life isn't fair. And it can be heart wrenching. And if you're having one of those dark days, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay to feel that darkness. When challenges and issues come back to back to back to back, and it seems like, Something is after me, something is attacking me, something is attacking my journey. Look for the lesson in it all. You will grow through what you go through. The question is, are you willing to go through it? When those bad things happen, what are you going to do? Are you gonna let this horrible situation dictate the way you feel and the way you handle it? Are you gonna fall over and fall down, and fall apart? Or are you going to face this issue with courage, and with resolution? You know darkness. So embrace. Embrace that darkness. Don't look away from it, own it. Step up to the challenge. No matter what you face, start walking. Take that step. Every day, no matter what you are facing, get up and start walking. And never surrender. And remember that even in the most wretched times, when you face darkness yourself, no matter how bad things get, remember not to stop, remember not to pause, remember not to hesitate, remember to put one foot in front of the other, take that first step, and start walking. And we will fight. And in fighting, we will win. And if not the battle, and if not the war, we will win because our spirit, it will never surrender. And that is the ultimate victory. To hold your head high. And even in the face of inescapable defeat, to stand and to fight, that is to win. Don't allow yourself a switch off button. I know there's always an answer. No matter how dark that place may be, there's always a way out. You just gotta keep going. Hold on to that fundamental quality of faith. Have faith. That on the other side of your pain is something good. ]]> </itunes:summary>

When I look at people, I always ask the question, I say, man tell me what Nike stands for. They said, Oh Ink that's easy, Just Do It. I said, tell me what Adidas stands for. Oh Ink that's easy man, Impossible Is Nothing. I said, now tell me what you stand for. When people look at you, do they think excuses? When people look at you, do they think victory? When people look at you, do they think, that's a person that's gonna give me everything they got, not on some days, but on every day, and it's not gonna be predicated upon if I feel like it, because I think we all know if we only worked on the days when we felt like it none of us would get much accomplished. I'm talking about the real level of commitment. Not the commitment that falls in line if everything goes right. I'm speaking of the commitment that says, I am going to stay true to what I said I would do, long after the mood that I've said it in has left. See, most people ladies and gentlemen, are stoppable. Most people, all you have to do is tell them no. All you have to do is make it inconvenient for them, all you have to do is make it difficult for them and they'll stop. See, when you go to get your goal, don't think that all you have to do is think positive and everything's gonna work out hokey dokey for you. When you go to get your goal, You are sending a telegram to Murphy's law to visit you personally. You thought you were just gonna have a dream and a goal, And you were just gonna wake up and just walk into the sunset. You're like, dream, boom. It don't work like that. You have a dream, and then life punks you. Life punks you and says, do you really want this? You're gonna lose friends, do you really want this? Do you really want this? Cousins are gonna abandon you, people that you used to be like this with gonna think you boujee and not wanna deal with you. It's a part of it. But I paid too much. If I was gonna quit, I would've quit in an abandoned building when I wanted to commit suicide and take my life. I should've quit when I heard my voice say, your mama don't want you, your daddy don't want you, take your life. I got through that, so why am I gonna quit over an F on a grade? Come on. And so I'm telling y'all, you have come too far to quit now. You have invested too much to quit now. You have lost too much to quit now. Don't cry about it, don't whine about it, get a reward for your pain. And so by being committed to everything that I started, I finished it, it built a certain type of spirit, it built a certain type of mentality, it built a certain type of individual. And so now, I couldn't quit even if I wanted to, I couldn't stop even if I wanted to, I have too much sweat equity in my life in everything that I was doing. You're too close to quit now. You gotta take another lap. You gotta take another lap, cause you never know, this might be the one. You can't stop cause you're tired, you can't stop cause you got your feelings hurt, you gotta take another lap. Keep walking. Keep walking. Keep walking. You're gonna make it. You're gonna do it. You got an unstoppable fire. Come on, take another lap. Don't you stop. Don't stop walking. ]]> </itunes:summary>

Transcript: Before April 1954, the common belief, the universal belief because it had been tried again & again & again, and people had failed the belief was that man was not physically capable of breaking the 4 minute barrier, that he could not run a mile in less than 4 minutes. When something happens to them, they begin to believe that that's the way it is. That's the way it's always been. And they can't see the possibility of it being any different. (250 yards to go and Bannister takes over) (watch his giant stride take him to the front) (as he races the last lung-bursting... ) Roger Bannister came along and he broke the 4-minute barrier! Since that time, up to this day Over 20,000 people have done it... including high-school kids! Twenty thousand people! What changed? Here's what happened when they got on the track: They knew it had been done! And because they knew it had been done, there was a new belief! ...about this barrier that was unreachable. And those twenty thousand people got in a race believing knowing in their heart that someone had done it that it's possible that they could do it if someone can make that dream become a reality, then you can make YOUR dream become reality Eyesight and mindsight... Eyesight is judging on what you see... ...judging according to appearances... but mindsight is how you interpret what you see. One guy said, its not possible, it's over, I'm finished! I can't do it. I can't make it. He surrendered! I've faced rejection again and again, I'm not going anymore! There are no jobs out there! But this other guy, he felt that in spite of the no's and rejections... ...in spite of how bad the economy is, in spite of what the newspapers are saying... that it's possible. That somebody somewhere, will give me a job. He just kept going! Thinking it was possible. And guess what ladies and gentlemen? That's what we have to do with our dreams. Because things happen to ya in life, that you can never ever anticipate. And many times when those things happen, you wanna give up! Easy is not an option. It's hard living! Life is hard... See it's hard when, when you are forty-nine years old, been working on a job for seventeen years... ...and they come in and tell you you're finished and give you one week's severance pay. And you gotta start all over again. It's hard handling just the tragedies of life. It's hard. When you're working on something, and, and you put everything you have in it... ...and it doesn't work out -- you lose your money and other people's money. Know what I discovered? When you're working at your dream, somebody said: the harder the battle, the sweeter the victory! It's good to ya -- why? See... ...what you become in the process that's more important than the dream! That's far more important! The kind of person you become the character that you build, the courage that you develop, the faith that you're manifesting! Oh it's, it's something that-- you get up, you look yourself in the mirror... you're a different kind of person, you walk with a different kind of spirit. You've got to have that kind of courage, that type of determination, if you wanna make it happen. It's you. You've got to take personal responsibility to make it happen. You must have faith! You've gotta believe in yourself! You've got to believe in your abilities, you`ve got to believe in your service, your company, your ideas! unquestionably! You`ve got to have faith, and that faith gives you... patience! But it`s not gonna happen as quickly as you want it to happen! New Voice: It`s yo` dream -- if you want it to happen -- get yo' butt up and make it happen! If you want it to happen -- rise and grind! I dare you not to go back to sleep! I dare you to get up! And I dare you to chase yo' dreams! Old Voice: It's possible you can win! Whatever comes to you, don't run from it. Don't try and duck it, like most people do... ...drive toward it! You wanna make your dreams come true? You gotta stay focused! Some people'd rather get even, than get ahead! Stay focused on where you wanna go! Where're you going with your life?

Transcript: Before April 1954, the common belief, the universal belief because it had been tried again & again & again, and people had failed the belief was that man was not physically capable of breaking the 4 minute barrier, that he could not run a mile in less than 4 minutes. When something happens to them, they begin to believe that that's the way it is. That's the way it's always been. And they can't see the possibility of it being any different. (250 yards to go and Bannister takes over) (watch his giant stride take him to the front) (as he races the last lung-bursting... ) Roger Bannister came along and he broke the 4-minute barrier! Since that time, up to this day Over 20,000 people have done it... including high-school kids! Twenty thousand people! What changed? Here's what happened when they got on the track: They knew it had been done! And because they knew it had been done, there was a new belief! ...about this barrier that was unreachable. And those twenty thousand people got in a race believing knowing in their heart that someone had done it that it's possible that they could do it if someone can make that dream become a reality, then you can make YOUR dream become reality Eyesight and mindsight... Eyesight is judging on what you see... ...judging according to appearances... but mindsight is how you interpret what you see. One guy said, its not possible, it's over, I'm finished! I can't do it. I can't make it. He surrendered! I've faced rejection again and again, I'm not going anymore! There are no jobs out there! But this other guy, he felt that in spite of the no's and rejections... ...in spite of how bad the economy is, in spite of what the newspapers are saying... that it's possible. That somebody somewhere, will give me a job. He just kept going! Thinking it was possible. And guess what ladies and gentlemen? That's what we have to do with our dreams. Because things happen to ya in life, that you can never ever anticipate. And many times when those things happen, you wanna give up! Easy is not an option. It's hard living! Life is hard... See it's hard when, when you are forty-nine years old, been working on a job for seventeen years... ...and they come in and tell you you're finished and give you one week's severance pay. And you gotta start all over again. It's hard handling just the tragedies of life. It's hard. When you're working on something, and, and you put everything you have in it... ...and it doesn't work out -- you lose your money and other people's money. Know what I discovered? When you're working at your dream, somebody said: the harder the battle, the sweeter the victory! It's good to ya -- why? See... ...what you become in the process that's more important than the dream! That's far more important! The kind of person you become the character that you build, the courage that you develop, the faith that you're manifesting! Oh it's, it's something that-- you get up, you look yourself in the mirror... you're a different kind of person, you walk with a different kind of spirit. You've got to have that kind of courage, that type of determination, if you wanna make it happen. It's you. You've got to take personal responsibility to make it happen. You must have faith! You've gotta believe in yourself! You've got to believe in your abilities, you`ve got to believe in your service, your company, your ideas! unquestionably! You`ve got to have faith, and that faith gives you... patience! But it`s not gonna happen as quickly as you want it to happen! New Voice: It`s yo` dream -- if you want it to happen -- get yo' butt up and make it happen! If you want it to happen -- rise and grind! I dare you not to go back to sleep! I dare you to get up! And I dare you to chase yo' dreams! Old Voice: It's possible you can win! Whatever comes to you, don't run from it. Don't try and duck it, like most people do... ...drive toward it!

<description> <![CDATA[ DECIDE TO WIN! The 12th Ultimate 30-Minute Motivational Speech Compilation is here! These are some of the best Motivational Videos that I have ever heard and that I continue to listen to to get motivated!

►From 1:07 to 7:00 is all NEW!
This is a re-upload/remake as we were having issues with the other version from last week. Even though it was at 100k views I decided it was worth it to take it down and make it better.

<itunes:summary> <![CDATA[ Thank you to Tom Bilyeu for providing the amazing interview and speech!
Check out his awesome channel here: https://www.youtube.com/TomBilyeu


You don’t have to be a rocket scientist to understand the struggles of growing up in South Central, Los Angeles. Olympia Lepoint was stabbed in the face by a young gang member and at times ate only ice because her family could not afford food. Though she failed every level of high school math, her insane work ethic landed here in the top five of her college class --with a degree in mathematics. Her struggle continued as a woman of color in a male-dominated world. Despite facing hazing and discrimination on every hand, she found a way to leverage her talent and drive to become an award-winning rocket scientist who helped NASA launch 28 space missions. Meet the woman that People Magazine named the modern day Hidden Figure in this thought-provoking episode of Impact Theory with Tom Bilyeu.

<itunes:subtitle>Jack Ma - THIS IS WHY YOU FAIL Motivational Video 2018</itunes:subtitle>
<itunes:summary> <![CDATA[ Jack Ma: THIS IS WHY YOU FAIL (Motivational Video 2018).
Alibaba’s Jack Ma, China’s second-richest man, visits Obama at the White House

When it comes to solving really hard problems, Ma has a famous quote that I love: Today is hard. Tomorrow will be worse. But the day after that will be beautiful. Most of your talent won't make it past tomorrow. But as a leader, you must inspire people through those hardest times: To stick with it, to move through it, and to see past it so they can make it to the day where things are beautiful. That's when you're really innovating. You have get your team there.

I'm a dropout of Harvard Business School, but I took a very helpful leadership class while I was there that really stuck with me. We discussed looking at problems from every angle, and looking at the person inside the puzzle. See their picture, their concern, their point of view, and understand that people feel passionately the way they do. Your job is to see the 360º and come up with the answers.

On the flip side, you have to balance this by pushing people to their boundaries. How do you get there, if most people don't make it past Jack Ma's tomorrow? You ache to get talent to do things they've never done before. And that's hard.

TIME.
Most of us act like we are going to live forever. We slave away now, believing that ONE DAY when we retire or make it thing will be better and we will be happier, but none of us are guaranteed a tomorrow, next week or next year.
NOW is the time to start enjoying life. NOW is the time to start going after your dreams and doing all the things YOU want to do.
Make that decision, nothing is more important than YOUR happiness and start living. NOW

<itunes:summary> <![CDATA[ CONTROL YOUR THINKING (MOTIVATIONAL VIDEO 2018)
Many people fail to go after what they want in life because they think their best days are behind them. It's NEVER TOO LATE to create your best ever life. No matter what age you are, no matter how many past failures, it is NEVER TOO LATE.
It's NEVER TOO LATE because SUCCESS is all in the mind. You can define success however you like, so as long as you have the ability to control your mind you have the ability to create your best ever life.

If it is financial or material success you are seeking, it is never too late for that either.
You are only a google click away from a world full of late success stories. Some of the greatest, most successful humans on the planet only made it big later in life.
Never give up, you are capable of anything you can imagine.

You should be grateful for your past. The good times and especially the challenging times, because all of it formed who you are today.
Be grateful for the hard times in your past, grateful for the lessons, grateful for the strength it gave you. Then, DECIDE that your FUTURE is more important than holding on. Let go of any negativity towards your past, people or events, and FOCUS on building your greatest ever future.

Jim Kwik is a globally recognized leader in memory improvement, brain performance, and accelerated learning. In his lifetime, he’s sustained two traumatic brain injuries that left him with significant learning disabilities. But despite the obstacles he had to overcome in recovery, he became obsessed with the brain and its superpower-like capabilities. He has now turned his obsession into a revolutionary accelerated learning system that has helped numerous celebrity clients and students in over 150 countries. Jim Kwik sits down with Tom Bilyeu to discuss intriguing insights in hacking the brain in this week’s episode of Impact Theory.

Tom Bilyeu is the co-founder of 2014 Inc. 500 company Quest Nutrition — a unicorn startup valued at over $1 billion — and the co-founder and host of Impact Theory.

<itunes:summary> <![CDATA[ How to Love Yourself AGAIN (Motivational Video)
When people start to love themselves more each day, it’s amazing how their lives get better. They feel better. They get the jobs they want. They have the money they need. Their relationships either improve, or the negative ones dissolve and new ones begin.

It’s a very simple premise—loving yourself. I’ve been criticized for being too simplistic, and I have found that the simple things are usually the most profound.

Someone said to me recently, “You gave me the most wonderful gift—you gave me the gift of myself.” So many of us hide from ourselves and we don’t even know who we are. We don’t know what we feel, we don’t know what we want.

Life is a voyage of self discovery. To me, to be enlightened is to go within and to know who and what we really are, and to know that we have the ability to change for the better by loving and taking care of ourselves.

It’s not selfish to love ourselves. It clears us so that we can love ourselves enough to love other people. We can really help the planet when we come from a space of great love and joy on an individual basis.

The Power that created this incredible Universe has often been referred to as love. God is love. We have often heard the statement: Love makes the world go ’round. It’s all true. Love is the binding agent that holds the whole Universe together.

To me, love is a deep appreciation. When I talk about loving ourselves, I mean having a deep appreciation for who we are. We accept all the different parts of ourselves—our little peculiarities, the embarrassments, the things we may not do so well, and all the wonderful qualities, too.

<itunes:summary> <![CDATA[ FIND YOURSELF (BEST MOTIVATIONAL VIDEO 2018)
Figuring out who we are and what we want out of life can be challenging if at any point you, like me, veered off the course of self-exploration and self-acceptance.

But eventually, life smacks us in the face enough times that we’re forced to admit the truth: we’re totally lost.

In that moment, there is surrender to something much bigger than our individual selves, and we start this journey again. Only this time, we’re present; we’re tuned in to what’s up, and we’re ready.

The path to figuring it all out requires a determination to stay committed to the trail, to hang on and keep moving forward, even when it gets tough – which it does. We travel to our darkest depths inside ourselves and see everything we’ve hidden, covered up, locked, and repressed.

It all surfaces and it’s a wild ride. But, there’s a light at the end of the tunnel: our perspectives about our selves and this life shift tremendously and open the doors for some miraculous opportunities, love, and peace.

I’ve learned some of these lessons the hard way, but once I learned them, life became a lot clearer and the road to wherever I’m going piqued by becoming effortless and enjoyable in more moments than not. There are still times that arise which aren’t so picturesque, I’m just better equipped to ride that rocky wave and can remind myself to settle into what I know.

Speakers:
Jada Pinkett Smith
Tony Robbins
Jim Rohn
Les Brown

Do you tend to control the events in your life, or are events controlling you? The amount of stress you feel is directly related to how in control you feel about your life.

It’s easy to let other things take control of us – unless we take control of our own minds. What we choose to focus on has a massive effect on how we feel. If you focus on the things you can’t control – such as the past, or what’s missing from your life – you feel stressed, overwhelmed, and depressed. Even if you’re taking antidepressants, you’re still going to feel depressed if you’re focusing on the things in your life that are out of your control!

Leaders focus on what they can control, what they have, and what they want. Once you change your focus in this way, you will become a creator again, instead of just a manager of your life. It’s easy to lose that vision as you experience disappointments along the way. We’ve all been there – life seems to crush something that you were excited about, or someone betrays you, or you betray yourself.
“Focus on where you want to go not on what you fear”

To create a life where you’re thriving, not just surviving, you must focus on creating a compelling future. Pick anything – a goal, dream, or desire – that you want so much, you’re going to find yourself compelled to make it happen.

The great thing is, if you think about it, you’ve actually already done this before. Whether or not you’ve been keeping track of it along the way, there are things that you’ve wanted and have gotten for yourself. You are responsible for everything that you have in your life today. If you want to thrive, you have to focus on the things you can control, the difference you can make, and the things that are already in your life that you’re grateful for.

<itunes:subtitle>Elon Musk - 18 Laws of Success Motivational Video</itunes:subtitle>
<itunes:summary> <![CDATA[ Elon Musk: 18 Laws of Success (Motivational Video)
Elon Musk is the co-founder, CEO and Product Architect at Tesla, overseeing all product development, engineering, and design of the company's electric vehicles, battery products, and solar roofs.

Since the company’s inception in 2003, Tesla’s mission has been to accelerate the transition to a sustainable energy future. The first Tesla product, the Roadster sports car, debuted in 2008, followed by the Model S Sedan, which was introduced in 2012, and the Model X SUV, which launched in 2015. Model S was named Motor Trend 2013 Car of the Year, received Consumer Reports’ Best Overall Car and earned the highest-ever safety rating awarded by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. In 2017, Tesla will begin deliveries of Model 3, a $35,000 mass-market electric car with over 215 miles of range.

In 2015, Tesla introduced two energy storage products, the Powerwall home battery and the Powerpack industrial-scale battery. In 2016, Tesla acquired SolarCity, the leading provider of solar power systems in the United States, and in 2017 will release the Solar Roof, a beautiful and affordable energy generation product.

Elon is also the co-founder, CEO, and lead designer of Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX), where he oversees the development and manufacturing of advanced rockets and spacecraft for missions to and beyond Earth orbit, with the goal of creating a self-sustaining city on Mars. He is also the co-founder and chairman of OpenAI, a non-profit research company working to build safe artificial intelligence and ensure that AI's benefits are as widely and evenly distributed as possible.

Previously, Elon co-founded and sold PayPal, the world's leading Internet payment system, and Zip2, one of the first internet maps and directions services, which helped bring major publishers like the New York Times and Hearst online.

<itunes:subtitle>Nick Vujicic - STAND STRONG Most Powerful Speech</itunes:subtitle>
<itunes:summary> <![CDATA[ Nick Vujicic: STAND STRONG (Most Powerful Speech)
ABOUT STAND STRONG

With no arms, no legs, and no defense, Nick Vujicic was once a bully’s target and knows what it feels like to be picked on and pushed around:  It makes your stomach hurt, gives you nightmares, and feels like there is no hope in sight. But Nick shows how you too can overcome and rise above bullying.




No Bully Can Define Who You Are

Nick has experienced bullying of all kinds for being “different.” But he’s learned that he doesn’t have to play the bully’s game–and neither do you. In Stand Strong Nick gives you strategies for developing a “bully defense system,” so you can handle bullies of all kinds by building your strength from the inside out.




Find out how to:

·     Turn being bullied into a great opportunity (yes, really!)

·     Create a safety zone within yourself

·     Establish strong values that no bully can shake

·     Deal with cyber bullies

·     Develop a spiritual foundation to stay strong against bullying

·     Monitor your emotions and control your response to them

·     Help others who are being bullied

Are you facing the unwanted attention of a bully?  You can stand up to the challenge, because you have greater power over your feelings and your life than you may think! Just ask Nick–the man with no arms or legs…and “a ridiculously good life.”

<itunes:summary> <![CDATA[ Jack Ma: Success Can Come at Any Age (Jack Ma 2017)
When it comes to solving really hard problems, Ma has a famous quote that I love: Today is hard. Tomorrow will be worse. But the day after that will be beautiful. Most of your talent won't make it past tomorrow. But as a leader, you must inspire people through those hardest times: To stick with it, to move through it, and to see past it so they can make it to the day where things are beautiful. That's when you're really innovating. You have get your team there.

I'm a dropout of Harvard Business School, but I took a very helpful leadership class while I was there that really stuck with me. We discussed looking at problems from every angle, and looking at the person inside the puzzle. See their picture, their concern, their point of view, and understand that people feel passionately the way they do. Your job is to see the 360º and come up with the answers.

On the flip side, you have to balance this by pushing people to their boundaries. How do you get there, if most people don't make it past Jack Ma's tomorrow? You ache to get talent to do things they've never done before. And that's hard.

Many of us, as we were growing up, learned to ignore our inner experience and instead we learned to focus on others. Our ego wounded self learned to tune into what others were feeling in the hopes of having control over feeling safe.

Where you put your focus depends upon on what you believe makes you feel happy and safe. If you believe that your happiness and safety come from others liking you, connecting with you, approving of you, loving you, or spending time with you, then your focus is likely to be on others.

If you believe that your happiness and safety come from connecting with yourself and with your higher guidance, and from approving of yourself, defining your own worth, spending time with yourself, taking loving action for yourself, and sharing your love and caring with others, then your focus is likely to be within. In other words, if you believe your happiness and safety come from getting love, your focus will be on others. If you believe your happiness and safety come from being loving with yourself and others, your focus will be within.
